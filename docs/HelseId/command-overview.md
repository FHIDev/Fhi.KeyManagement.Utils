1. **Update klientkonfiguration scope:** The client must have registered the _nhn:selvbetjening/client_ scope in order for an application to use the tool. The scope _nhn:selvbetjening/client_ to klientsystem must be added to the client system and klientkonfigurasjon.
1. **Update client with public key:** The HelseId client should be updated with the newly generated keys. This is done with the command `updateclientkey`.
1. **Update application with private key**: The application configuration must be updated with the new private key for seamless integration with the updated client.
